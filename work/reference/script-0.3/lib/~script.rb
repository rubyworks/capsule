# A module which is an instance of the Script class encapsulates in its scope
# the top-level methods, top-level constants, and instance variables defined in
# a ruby script file (and its subfiles) loaded by a ruby program. This allows
# use of script files to define objects that can be loaded into a program in
# much the same way that objects can be loaded from YAML or Marshal files.
#
# See intro.txt[link:files/intro_txt.html] for an overview.
